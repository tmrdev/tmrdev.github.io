        <h4>What is Ergo Payment Portal ?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">This dApp intends to ease <a href="https://ergoplatform.org/en/"
                target="_blank">Ergo</a> payments for small businesses and personal usage. It provides
            a way to integrate Ergo or SigUSD payments in other applications, allowing to request a payment from
            an URL.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>How does it works ?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">A seller can <a href="./index.html">create an URL</a> to the payment portal in order
            to receive a payment. This URL
            includes the address for the payment, the currency (ERG or SigUSD), the amount and a customizable reference
            for the seller.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">The buyer is redirected to the payment page buy clicking on the link, he is invited to
            sign the transaction to proceed the payment, the sample link following suggests a donation of 1 ERG for this dApp.

        </a>
        
        <p class="text-justify">Once the transaction is confirmed, the <a href="./voucher.html">Voucher page</a> allows
            the seller to view the list of received payments.</p>

        <a href="https://thierrym1212.github.io/paymentportal/voucher.html?address=9ew97YCt7zQDwmLsytMAWGj2kockM11PFCnRvT2cz9LQaaB7uPG"

        </a>
        <p class="text-justify">And additional tool "monitor-vouchers" is included in the git repository in order to be
            able to monitor the
            received payments in an automated way retreiving a json file.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>How can I proceed a payment ?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">You need to install a Chrome extension extension configure an ergo wallet with some ERGs: </p>
        <p class="text-justify">- <a href="https://github.com/ThierryM1212/SAFEW/releases">SAFEW</a></p>
        <p class="text-justify">- <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/nautilus-wallet/gjlmehlldlphhljhpnlddaodbjjcchai">Nautilus</a></p>
        <p class="text-justify">- <a href="https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/yoroi/ffnbelfdoeiohenkjibnmadjiehjhajb">Yoroi</a></p>
        <p class="text-justify">The application will propose you to connect your the wallet when loading.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">Only one wallet extension with dApp connector needs to be enabled in your browser.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>How the dApp is working ?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">The application is distributed as a static webpage and is executed in your browser.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">The transactions are sent to your wallet dApp connector so you can review and sign them.
        </p>
        <p class="text-justify">Once validated with the wallet dApp connector a transaction is sent to the blockchain, it
            cannot be cancelled or reverted. Review it carefully.
        </p>
        <br />

        <h4>How to integrate the Ergo and/or SigUSD payments in my website ?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">You will need to generate a valid payment link to the Ergo Payment portal from your
            website in order to use the deployed dApp. You can use the "reference" field in order to store up to 40
            ascii characters, to identify the payment once received.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">The application is opensource, it can be cloned, adapted to your need and ran as a
            static webpage on your web server, with no dApp fee.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">The received payments can be monitored using the Voucher page of the dApp or in an
            automated way
            running the voucher-monitor tool provided with the application</p>
        <br />

        <h4>What is the fee ?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">The application currently deployed here has a 0.1% fee with a mininimum of 0.001 ERG or
            0.01 SigUSD,
            the fee is removed from the amount sent by the buyer and so is paid "by the seller".</p>
        <p class="text-justify">The "buyer" will pay only the Ergo transaction fee additionnally to the amount requested
            to proceed the transaction.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">The application is opensource and can be installed as a static webpage, it is possible
            to configure the fee to 0.</p>
        <p class="text-justify">To integrate the ergo payment in your website, you could deploy this dApp on your server
            and set the fee to 0.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>Why I don't have the pleasure to accept the RGPD or the cookies to use the dApp ?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">The application does not use cookies and does not store or manipulate personal data on
            server side. It is delivered as a static webpage running in your browser.</p>
        <br />

        <h4>Where can I review the application ?</h4>
        <p class="text-justify">The code of the application is hosted on gihub:<a
                href="https://github.com/ThierryM1212/ergo-pay" target="_blank">&nbsp;Github repository</a></p>
        <br />

        <h4>What if I find a bug ?</h4>
